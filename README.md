# Welcome to CS 153: Compiler Design

In this git repository each folder is a fully importable Eclipse project.
**Assignment 3** - **Assignment 5** deal with studying Pascal Compiler source code and adding features into to the Pascal compiler.

**Assignment 6** and **Assignment 7** are the beginning parts of our compiler where we build a compiler by using a Compiler-Compiler called javaCC. 

**TestScript** is the final Eclipse project base on the [TypeScript language specs] (http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook). TestScript is sectioned into 3 packages frontend/Intermediate/backend. The project includes test programs that can be compiled and run using the JVM. Each sample program produces a .jasmine file which then can be compiled into a corresponding .class file and executed on the JVM.  

**Build Requirements**
* Eclipse
* JavaCC plugin for eclipse 
* jasmin.jar 
* java 7
