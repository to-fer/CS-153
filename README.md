# Welcome to CS 153: Compiler Design

In this git repository each folder is a fully importable Eclipse project.
**Assignment 3** - **Assignment 5** deal studying the design of a compiler by studying a Pascal Compiler source code and adding features into to Pascal compiler.

**Assignment 6** and **Assignment 7** are the beginning parts of our compiler where we build a compiler from scratch based on a language that we create. 

**TestScript** is the final Eclipse project that if the Compiler for our own language called TestScript, base of TypeScript. TestScript is sectioned into 3 packages frontend/Intermediate/backend. The project includes test programs that can be compiler run using the JVM. Each sample program produces a .jasmine file which then can be compiled into a corresponding .class file and run on JVM.  

### TestScipt supports 

* Data Types
	* reals
	*  boolean 
	* strings
*  Variables 
* Control Structure 
	* if 
	* if/else  (not nested)
	* while loops 
* Expression 
	* operators 
		* +, - , *, /
* Conditionals 
	* <, > , <= , >= , != 
* Function 
	* void 
	* parameters (valid syntax, but not being added to backend) 
	* recursive functions
