# Final Compiler project

During the last half of the semester, each programming team will develop a compiler
using the JavaCC compiler-compiler. This project will involve:
* Creating the grammar for the source language. This can be an existing
procedure-oriented language (or subset thereof), or you can invent your own
source language. No Lisp or Lisp-like languages. As noted above, CS 253 teams
must each invent a new language.
* Generating the scanner and the parser for the source language using JavaCC.
* Developing the code generator that will emit Jasmin assembly code for the
JVM. A Jasmin assembler will be provided.
* Executing compiled example programs written in your chosen source language.
